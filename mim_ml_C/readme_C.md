1. Running mim_ml_C.py script shows 1H chemical shift prediction of a test PDB structure (5UZF).
2. pdb folder has all the PDB files and MIM-NMR calculated chemical shifts.
3. pdb_test folder has the PDB files of the test sets used in this study.
4. xtb folder has all the GFN2-xTB output files, and xtb_info.py and gbsa.py can be used to extract data which is used by the mim_ml_C.py script.
