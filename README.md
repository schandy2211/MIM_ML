# ðŸ§  MIM-ML: Predicting NMR Shifts of Nucleic Acids using ML + Quantum Fragments

MIM-ML is a Random Forest-based machine learning model that predicts **Â¹H and Â¹Â³C NMR chemical shifts** of nucleic acids using quantum chemical fragment-based descriptors.

It combines **structural and electronic features** derived from low-cost semi-empirical (GFN2-xTB) calculations, trained on high-accuracy DFT chemical shifts computed via the **Molecules-in-Molecules (MIM)** fragmentation scheme.

## ðŸ”¬ Why This Matters

Traditional quantum NMR predictions are computationally expensive for biomolecules.  
MIM-ML enables:
- **Rapid predictions** for large nucleic acids
- **Accuracy comparable to full DFT**, with orders of magnitude less cost
- **Integration of electronic + structural features** from quantum fragments
